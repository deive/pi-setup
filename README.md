# pi-setup
Raspberry Pi Raspbian headless setup automation script.

My automation for creating headless setups on Ubuntu for Raspbian (including Lite).

```
git clone git@github.com:deive/pi-setup.git
cd pi-setup
chmod +x pi-setup
./pi-setup
```

This requires root access (and will ask for it)

I have commented some of the script so please read before running!

You can use a config file for the values, instead of the interactive shell:
```
mv pi_setup.config.example pi_setup.config
nano pi_setup.config
```
